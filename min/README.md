# Business Analytics WS1617 - Group 8 Project

### How To Run

We have split out project into several files.  Here's a quick overview of how to use our models.

1) Rscript export2csv.R
2) run jupyter Notebooks

You don't need step zero, but it might be helpful if you have problems with the scripts

### Requirements

For R, our scripts install the required libraries as needed.  For python, we used Anaconda to install the requirements.  The following will install the required libraries:

```

conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn
conda install -c glemaitre imbalanced-learn

```

### Miscellaneous

We have several miscellaneous scripts that we used to support our work during the project.  In the data preparation stage, we used R to do a lot of our data exploration.  We outputed a lot of graphs and LaTex tables with the data_prep_tables.R and the data_prep_plots.R files.  We also used [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to visual our code.  Our code allowed us to play with a lot of options, far too many possible options to test exhaustively.  We've included some notebooks of models or ideas that we felt were interesting but ultimately, we did not use.
